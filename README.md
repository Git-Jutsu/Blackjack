# Blackjack
A blackjack game created with HTML ,CSS, and JavaScript. On this game, the goal is to reach  a score of 21 by adding cards. If the player score goes above 21 then they are given a message stating they are out of the game. If they have not reached a score of 21 then they are given an option to add another card. The cards are randomized so the player does not know what card they will be given. The dollar amount is hardcoded to $100
